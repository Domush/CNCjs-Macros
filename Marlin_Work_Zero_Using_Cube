; This script enables the automation of zeroing out new bits to a workpiece using a conductive Zeroing Cube,
; while also automatically measuring and accounting for bit radius.
;
; !! Intended for Marlin 2.xx users, but may work for other firmware with slight adjustments
;
; Link to (3D printable) Zeroing Cube used in this script: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5029043

; Start with end mill roughly in center of cube, with bit slightly (~3mm-10mm) above cube surface.
; Bit must extend BELOW the top of the zero cube walls (so it touches them on a lateral move)

; Wait until the planner queue is empty
%wait

; Set user-defined variables
; !! All measurements are in mm (not in Luddite units, you savages)
